Codex - simple vanilla JS event site (static)
=============================================

This project is a ready-to-run static website that uses Firebase Firestore
to store events and submissions.

How to use
----------

1. Replace placeholders in `js/firebase.js` with your Firebase project's config. done
2. Serve the files (open `index.html` locally or use a static host like Firebase Hosting). done
3. From Admin panel (`admin.html`) schedule events and start them. done
4. Participants visit `events.html` to see active event and submit. done

Notes
-----
- Admin panel currently has no authentication (open access). Add Firebase Auth for protection.
- This is a minimal starter; feel free to extend and style it.
